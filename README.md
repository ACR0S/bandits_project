Repo of the Data Science Project course (5AIASX05)

Useful documentation will be stored in the `/documentation` folder.

If someone wants to share some code, they can upload it directly to the `main` branch or create a new branch for day-to-day work and later merge with `main` once the code is pretty clean.
