# bandits_project
Repo of the Data Science Project course (5AIASX05).

Useful documentation will be stored in the `/documentation` folder.

If someone wants to share some code, they can upload it directly to the `main` branch or create a new branch for day-to-day work and later merge with `main` once the code is pretty clean.


## Ideas

- Retrieve description / reviews from IMDB using `imdbId` and apply some basic Sentiment Analysis technique to add more features for recommendation (what type of films does a specific user like, etc.).
